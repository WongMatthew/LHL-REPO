## Python Basics
==========================

* What is Python?
    * Dynamically typed
    * expressive
        * can make it shape into different languages
        * python works w/ C
    * Free and open source
        * anyone can use it, everyone shares code
    * Interpreted
        * 
    * High-level
    * portable
    * object oriented
    * GUI programming
    * dynamically typed
    * interpreted
    * embeddable
    * extensible

* Why python for data sci?
    * simple programming language
    * python has an active community w/ a vast selection of libraries and resources
    * professionals in data sci dont want to be bogged down w/ complicating programmign requirements
        * would use languages like python/ruby to perform tasks 

* Jupyter
    * Provides python environment
    * Working w/ notebooks
        * **Code Cells**
        * **Markdown Cells**
        * Defaults to code cells 

* Libraries in the python ecosystem
    * pandas
    * jupyter
    * NumPy
    * Matplotlib
    * Cython

* Built in data types - values & objects
    * working w/ values
    * int
    * float
    * str
    * bool
    * list
    * sets
    * tuples
