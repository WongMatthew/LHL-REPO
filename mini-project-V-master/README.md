The repo with instructions for Mini Project V

Welcome to the last mini-project of this bootcamp. We hope you will enjoy it. 

## NLP

We will combine our skills from Deep Learning and NLP and create our own language translator.

Don't worry if you don't have very powerful computer. We understand that it is the concept and approach that counts the most in this case. Make sure to catch interesting or funny (aka not good) translations and we will have some fun during the presentation.

Enjoy!!
